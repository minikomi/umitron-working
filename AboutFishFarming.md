# Some concepts:

- **生簀 / Fish pen / Fish cage**

    - A cage usually made of metal frames and nets, used to grow fish inside.
    - Small farmers typically manage around 10 cages at the same time while large farmers may manage a few hundred at once.
    - Farmers usually give their cages simple names based on their geographic location. e.g. cages starting from upper left corner is successively A1, A2, B1, B2…
- **魚群 / 稚魚 / 種苗 / Juvenile / Seedling**

    - Fish seedlings farmers buys from seed makers.
    - Different kind of fish takes different amount of time to raise. For example red sea breams typically takes two years to raise.
    - Japanese farmers usually name them as `{year bought}{maker name}{suffix}`,e.g. 21山崎春, fish bought in 2021 Spring from the maker 山崎.
    - Farmers usually buys juveniles from different makers.
    - Whenever they buy new juveniles, they buy them in tens of thousands, and put them in multiple cages.
- **ロット / Fish group / Fish lot**

    - A fish lot is what we call the combination of a fish cage and a kind of juvenile.
    - Fish lots are the basic unit of operation. e.g. 200kg feed were given to fish lot A1-J1 today.
    - Fish lots may change during the lifecycle of a juvenile. e.g. juvenile J1 were put into cage A1 on 1st Jan (fish lot A1-J1), then those fish were moved to cage A3 on 1st Sep and became a new fish lot (A3-J1)

# A simple illustration of the lifecycle of fish farming:

1. 40,000 juveniles of red sea bream were brought from maker MJ on the 1st April 2021, those juveniles were evenly divided into two fish cages A1 and B1, each 20,000 fish.

2. Each day, some amount of feed were given to the fish.

3. Unfortunately, some fish died during the process.

4. The fish grew quickly under the farmers’ care. On 1st June, the fish grew from its original size of 100 grams per fish to 600 grams per fish! Now with a little less than 20,000 fish per cage of this size, it’s getting a little too crowded… So the farmers decides to further split the cages.

5. Now it’s September 2022, it’s been a year and a half of hard working fish raising! The fish are now 3kg per fish and finally it’s time to start selling. Each day we’ll sell some fish, and we sell them at different prices to different dealers.

6. Now that a lot of the fish has been sold, each of the cages only has a few thousand fish left. What a waste of space and effort to raise them in separately! The farmers decide to merge the remaining fish. Let’s move them all to C2.

7. The remaining fish are now continued to be raised in C2 until all of them are sold. Then the clean the cage and put new fish in them.
